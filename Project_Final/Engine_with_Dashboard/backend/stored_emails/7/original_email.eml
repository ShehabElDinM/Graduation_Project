I'm still seeing this.  It reports to honor.cloudmark.com but checks
against apt.cloudmark.com.  What is the sync delay between these boxes?

I noticed a low count of razor'd spam messages. So after digging, if I
razor-report a message the diags say that it was accepted but if I turn
around and run a check on the exact same message that was reported, then
it doesn't find the sig and as such isn't spam.
